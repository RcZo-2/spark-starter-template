# Local Development Environment Setup Tutorial

This guide will walk you through setting up a local development environment for your project.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: Version control system.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: For JavaScript-based environments (adjust based on your stack).
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: For containerized development (optional).

## 2. Steps to Set Up Local Environment

Follow these steps to get your local development environment up and running.

| Step No. | Description                                          | Command/Action                         |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1        | Clone the repository                                | `git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git` |
| 2        | Navigate to the project folder                      | `cd repo-folder`                       |
| 3        | Install project dependencies (for Node.js example)  | `npm install`                          |
| 4        | Start the development server                        | `npm start`                            |
| 5        | Access the app in the browser                       | `http://localhost:3000`                |

## 3. Configuration (Optional)

You may need to configure additional settings depending on the project.

| Configuration     | Description                                      | Example Value    |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Database URL**   | URL for connecting to your local database        | `localhost:5432` |
| **API Key**        | Key for accessing third-party APIs               | `1234ABCD5678`   |
| **Environment**    | Specify development or production environment   | `development`    |

## 4. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Error: Port already in use"
- **Solution**: Kill the process using the port.
    - On macOS/Linux: `lsof -i :3000` then `kill -9 <PID>`
    - On Windows: Use Task Manager to find and kill the process.

### Issue 2: "Missing dependencies"
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
